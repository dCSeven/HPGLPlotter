HPGL Plotter
============

A plotter for the ATMega8

It gets the data via the UART (RS232-like and interrupt driven) and plots it out with some steppers (even interrupt driven).
The processing of the Input is done in the main loop.

It is a project for my school, so it should be finnished in April 2014.

The files outside of Main are for testing purposes (or documentation)
